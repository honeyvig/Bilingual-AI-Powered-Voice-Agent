# Bilingual-AI-Powered-Voice-Agent
AI Developer to design and implement a Hindi and English AI-powered Voice Agent that interacts with users. The AI Voice Agent’s primary role will be to promptly assess the nature of the request — distinguishing between a real emergency, service request, etc — and respond in natural language accordingly. This role requires expertise in NLP, voice recognition, real-time decision-making, and an understanding of emergency response protocols.


Responsibilities:
AI Voice Agent Design and Development
Develop and deploy a responsive AI Voice Agent that initiates a call-back when a DrRing device user presses the alert button.
Implement language processing capabilities to enable natural, human-like conversations in multiple major Indian languages.
Enable the AI to dynamically switch languages based on user preferences.


Testing and Validation
Conduct testing to ensure accuracy in understanding and handling all call scenarios.
Perform language and accent adaptability tests to optimize the AI’s effectiveness in different Indian languages and dialects.
Continuous Learning and Improvement
Implement self-learning mechanisms to improve the AI's response based on previous interactions.
Set up feedback loops to refine call handling and response for improved accuracy and user experience.


Qualifications:
Proven experience in building and deploying conversational AI or voice agents, preferably in emergency response or customer service settings.
Proficiency in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Natural Language Understanding (NLU), and multilingual voice recognition.
Strong understanding of machine learning algorithms, intent recognition, and decision-making processes.
===================
Python code outline to help you get started on developing a bilingual AI-powered Voice Agent capable of understanding Hindi and English. This implementation uses tools like Google Cloud Speech-to-Text for voice recognition, Google Text-to-Speech for voice responses, and an NLP model like spaCy or OpenAI's GPT models for natural language understanding.

Features of the Code:

    Speech-to-Text:
        Uses Google Cloud Speech-to-Text to convert user audio into text.
        Supports both English (en-US) and Hindi (hi-IN).

    Language Detection:
        Detects whether the input is in Hindi or English using Unicode patterns.
        Can be extended with ML-based language detection models for greater accuracy.

    AI Response Generation:
        Integrates with OpenAI GPT-4 for natural and contextual responses.
        Dynamically adjusts language output based on detected input language.

    Text-to-Speech:
        Converts the generated text response back into speech using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech.
        Supports both Hindi and English voices.

    Multi-Turn Interaction:
        Designed to handle single queries but can be extended into multi-turn dialogue.

Prerequisites:

    Google Cloud credentials for Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech APIs.
    OpenAI API key for GPT integration.
    A .wav file input for user voice queries (16 kHz, mono recommended).

Future Enhancements:

    Emergency Detection:
        Integrate a decision tree or ML model to classify queries as emergencies or service requests.
    Support for More Languages:
        Expand language support for other major Indian languages like Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, etc.
    Real-Time Integration:
        Deploy the system on a cloud server with WebSocket or REST API for real-time interaction.
    Feedback Loop:
        Add a mechanism for users to provide feedback to improve responses over time.

This script provides a functional starting point for building an AI-powered voice agent capable of bilingual interaction.
